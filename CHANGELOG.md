# Changelog

## [0.4.2] - 2026-07-04

### Added
- **DSpark block speculative decoding** (DeepSeek DeepSpec). New lossless spec-decode
  mode: `fusion-mlx serve <model> --enable-dspark --dspark-drafter-path <draft>
  --dspark-draft-quant-bits 8`. Self-contained server forked early from normal serve
  init. A 5-layer context-injected drafter taps the target's own hidden states, proposes
  a 7-token block per round, and the target verifies it in a single forward pass via
  distribution-preserving rejection sampling (lossless). STS-calibrated confidence head
  (ECE 0.0846 -> 0.0184, AUROC preserved; `confidence_threshold=0.0` keeps STS inert,
  pruning monotonically hurts). New `supports_dspark` profile flag in `model_aliases`.

### Benchmark
- **Qwen3-8B-bf16 on Apple M5 Max 128GB** (median of 3 end-to-end HTTP serve runs):
  baseline vanilla serve 28.39 tok/s -> DSpark serve 48.15 tok/s = **+69.6%** (target
  was +50%). Lossless; greedy output is semantically equivalent to baseline. Results
  published to bench.dpdns.org (baseline id 2, DSpark id 3). See
  `docs/dspark-benchmark.md` for the full report.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-07-04

### Fixed
- **Speculative decode corruption on hybrid recurrent models.** On Qwen3.6-27B-mxfp8
  and other hybrid architectures (48 GatedDeltaNet recurrent layers + 16 full-attention
  layers, `ArraysCache`), speculative decoding produced incoherent repetition
  (`"useruseruser"`, `"Thinking1000000..."`) and overshot `max_tokens`. Root cause: the
  batched verify forward `model([D1..DK], cache)` computes recurrent state in parallel,
  but `ArraysCache` state must update sequentially — each token depends on the prior
  state — so batching derails it into a repetition fixed-point. Both n-gram and
  draft-model spec share this verify forward, so both corrupted identically.
  Fix: a boot-level gate in `engine_core.py` probes the loaded model's cache via the
  shared `model_has_recurrent_cache()` helper and skips both spec paths when recurrent
  layers are present, falling back to coherent pure decode. Pure-attention models keep
  speculative decode unchanged. The same probe powers `enrich_model_config`, so the boot
  gate and the config gate cannot drift apart.

### Benchmark
- **Coherent decode: ~18 tok/s overall / ~20 tok/s decode** (Apple M5 Max, 128 GB).
  This is the hardware ceiling for this 26.7 GB model — raw `mlx_lm.stream_generate`
  caps at 18.4 tok/s on the same hardware.
- **v0.4.0's reported 29.8 tok/s was a corrupt artifact, not real performance.** The
  0.4.0 benchmark measured speed only (HTTP API, `max_tokens=100`, 3 runs) and never
  coherence-tested the output. Every 0.4.0 spec-enabled run returned
  `completion_tokens=199` for `max_tokens=100` — a 99-token overshoot that is the
  signature of speculative decode — and the emitted text was incoherent repetition.
  0.4.0 running *coherently* (spec disabled) was also ~18 tok/s. **There is no real
  performance regression**: 0.4.1's coherent ~18 tok/s equals 0.4.0's true coherent
  throughput; 0.4.1 additionally fixes the corruption 0.4.0 shipped silently.

### Integrated (from v0.4.1-wip migration commits)
- Rapid-MLX tool parsers, omlx model patches, oQ quantizer, telemetry, MCP, middleware.

### Tests
- New `tests/unit/test_spec_recurrent_gate.py` (7 cases) covering the recurrent-cache
  probe and config enrichment. Net +7 passing, 0 regressions versus HEAD. 89 pre-existing
  failures from the rapid-mlx merge are documented test debt (broken
  `fusion_mlx.spec_decode` test imports) and are unrelated to this fix.

### macOS app
- The app's server-launch command (`python -m fusion_mlx.cli serve`) is verified coherent
  with this fix. The Swift app code is unchanged. Release `.app` bundles embed the
  `fusion_mlx` package from the worktree, so a rebuilt app includes this fix.
